# AI Real Execution Runbook

```text
document_type=REPOSITORY_REAL_EXECUTION_SAFETY_RUNBOOK
status=ACTIVE
scope=REAL_NETWORK_PRIVATE_DATA_HUMAN_GATE_DURABLE_STATE
```

This runbook is mandatory whenever a task can reach any of the following:

- real Yahoo, JPX, broker, or other external production network;
- private or sealed data, identities, or inputs;
- human-gated one-shot execution;
- durable machine-local production, gate, or audit state;
- raw acquisition or research opening; or
- direct Windows PowerShell prepared for any of the above.

It applies to the task author, ChatGPT, GPT-5.6 Sol, Codex, Claude Code
Cloud, and reviewers when they prepare, inspect, authorize, execute, or
report an in-scope operation.

## Authority and boundary

The frozen task or study design remains authoritative for methodology,
including provider, sentinel, windows, retry policy, thresholds, partitions,
sample rules, stopping rules, and gate semantics. The human gate remains the
ultimate authority. A task-specific stricter rule wins. This runbook supplies
stable operational safety only; it must never silently relax, reinterpret, or
replace a frozen study design. If a repair would change methodology or the
execution contract, stop and obtain a successor-study or other explicit
methodology decision from the GPT methodology authority and human authority.

Reusable real-execution safety belongs in this version-controlled runbook,
not in conversational memory or repeated long prompts. Repository-first and
delta-only prompt rules remain in `AI_RESEARCH_EXECUTION_RULES.md`.

## 1. Atomic PowerShell execution

A fail-closed real-execution command supplied to a user MUST be one atomic
PowerShell script block, normally `& { ... }`, or a pre-created reviewed
`.ps1` file. Do not provide independent lines where a `throw` can fail while
the user can continue pasting later commands.

The atomic scope MUST set the stop mode inside the scope:

```powershell
& {
    $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
    # Read-only provenance and state preflight.
    # Stop before the private/network/gate boundary unless every check passes.
    # Consume the one-shot gate only at the frozen boundary.
    try {
        # Authorized operation.
    }
    finally {
        # Clear any transient private environment values.
    }
}
```

Every preflight failure must terminate the whole block before any private,
network, or gate boundary. If an interactive continuation prompt `>>` is
present unexpectedly, instruct the user to press Ctrl+C before any further
execution. Long or one-shot execution must not depend on an AI-agent session
remaining alive.

A PowerShell `throw` terminates only the current statement/scope -- it does
not, and cannot, prevent the user from independently pasting and running a
further, unrelated command afterward in the same shell. This is exactly why
independent, sequential, standalone snippets are prohibited for protected
execution: a `throw` on an earlier line does not stop a later, separately
pasted line from still running. A single reviewed `& { ... }` block (or one
reviewed `.ps1` file, itself normally wrapped in a single top-level
`& { ... }` scope) does not have this problem, because control never returns
to the prompt until the entire scope has completed or failed as one unit.

## 2. Mandatory preflight before a boundary

Before any irreversible, private, network, or gate boundary, mechanically
verify every item applicable to the frozen design:

- correct repository;
- authoritative branch;
- exact expected local HEAD;
- exact authoritative remote HEAD;
- clean working tree;
- required commit, blob, and artifact bindings;
- frozen-design binding;
- reviewed-implementation binding;
- human-authority prerequisites;
- one-shot gate not already consumed;
- no conflicting durable execution binding, audit, or receipt;
- required private input exists and resolves uniquely.

Only after all required checks PASS may execution continue. A missing,
ambiguous, malformed, mismatched, stale, or unverifiable prerequisite is a
STOP condition. The preflight must not print private values while proving
these predicates.

## 3. Stale local checkout recovery

Never interpret a merely stale local checkout as a research or study failure.
First fetch `origin`. If, and only if, the authoritative remote HEAD equals
the exact expected SHA, the working tree is clean, the branch is correct, and
the current local HEAD is an ancestor of that expected SHA, a sync-only
pre-execution operation is allowed:

```powershell
git reset --hard <exact-expected-SHA>
```

This creates no methodology authority and consumes no gate. If ancestry,
branch, remote HEAD, cleanliness, or history is not exact, stop with
`EXPECTED_HEAD_MISMATCH` or `LOCAL_HISTORY_MISMATCH`, as applicable. Never
use `git pull`, merge, rebase, cherry-pick, or force as recovery. Re-run the
entire preflight from the beginning after an allowed sync.

## 4. Pre-gate versus post-gate failure

Classify the boundary before deciding authorization status or recovery. First
perform read-only state verification.

`PRE_GATE_FAILURE` means the one-shot gate was not consumed, the applicable
private or network boundary was not crossed, and real request count is zero
where that count is provable. Do not automatically declare a still-unused
authorization consumed. Only non-methodological, safe preflight repair may
be proposed; then run preflight again from the beginning.

`POST_GATE_FAILURE` means a durable one-shot gate was consumed. A crash or
BLOCK does not restore authorization. Do not retry, reset, delete a receipt,
generate a fresh nonce to bypass the gate, or reinterpret the same human
authorization. Follow the frozen stopping rule and return to the GPT
methodology authority and human authority for the next decision.

When the exact boundary cannot be proven, fail closed and do not assume
`PRE_GATE_FAILURE`.

## 5. Private path and file discovery

Never guess a private path. Never ask the user to paste a private path into
public or chat output when avoidable. Before the applicable authorized
content boundary, discovery is metadata-only.

Resolve candidate paths privately and count them without printing identities
or paths:

- zero candidates: STOP;
- exactly one candidate: it may proceed after all other checks PASS;
- more than one candidate: STOP for ambiguity.

Do not print ticker identities, private paths, raw payloads, prices,
features, outcomes, or raw authorization identity. Content reads require the
applicable authorization boundary. Safe evidence may expose only approved
hashes, counts, booleans, and safe aggregates.

## 6. PowerShell automatic variables

PowerShell variable names are case-insensitive. Do not use ordinary task
variables whose names collide with automatic variables. At minimum prohibit:

```text
Matches / matches
Error / error
Args / args
Input / input
Host / host
PID / pid
HOME / home
```

Prefer descriptive names such as `regexMatch`, `candidatePaths`,
`executionError`, and `privateManifestPath`. Apply this rule to every
variable in a prepared script, including variables in `catch`, `finally`,
and helper functions.

## 7. Execution environment

For real network, private-data, human-gated, or durable-machine-state
execution, default to direct Windows PowerShell. Claude Code Cloud and
Codex may prepare and statically inspect the command, but execution must not
depend on the lifetime of an AI-agent session. Long or one-shot work must be
prepared so it can continue on the Windows side after an SSH or agent
connection ends, when the frozen design permits that topology.

Local Claude Code remains prohibited by repository governance. Normal local
Codex editing and short validation are separate from direct execution and do
not authorize a private or network boundary.

## 8. Durable-state collision check

Before consuming a gate, read-only check every relevant existing durable
state location, including:

- gate receipt;
- production execution binding;
- audit aggregate or dossier where a deterministic conflict matters;
- verification receipt; and
- stage-specific durable state.

If existing state indicates a prior attempt or execution, STOP. Never delete,
reset, overwrite, or otherwise alter that state to obtain another attempt.
Durable publication must remain exclusive and no-overwrite when required by
the frozen design.

## 9. Transient secrets and private values

Raw human authorization identities and private paths must not be printed.
If a private value is temporarily placed in an environment variable, clear it
in a `finally` block even when the operation fails. Prefer public or durable
safe evidence consisting of SHA-256 values, counts, booleans, or safe
aggregates. Private ticker identities, raw URLs, and raw payloads must not
leak into logs, reports, exceptions, or receipts.

## 10. Frozen failure discipline

After a real BLOCK, the execution agent or ChatGPT must not, within the same
frozen study, silently:

- change provider;
- change a sentinel;
- change a readiness or acquisition window;
- add or change retry behavior;
- change a threshold;
- substitute another ticker or block;
- redraw a partition;
- alter sample inclusion or exclusion; or
- relax validation.

Follow the frozen stopping rule. If repair changes methodology or the
contract and was not explicitly pre-authorized, require a successor-study
decision. Operational recovery is not permission to retry a consumed
experiment.

## 11. Safe execution report contract

For real execution, report only safe values, where applicable, using this
contract:

```text
PRE_GATE_STATUS=<PASS|FAIL|UNKNOWN>
LOCAL_HEAD=<safe exact SHA or omitted when unavailable>
REMOTE_HEAD=<safe exact SHA or omitted when unavailable>
WORKING_TREE_CLEAN=<true|false|unknown>
GATE_CONSUMED=<true|false|unknown>
PRIVATE_READS=<nonnegative count|unknown>
NETWORK_REQUESTS=<nonnegative count|unknown>
YAHOO_REQUESTS=<nonnegative count|unknown>
JPX_REQUESTS=<nonnegative count|unknown>
EXECUTION_RESULT=<safe enum>
FAILURE_CLASS=<safe enum or NONE>
DURABLE_EVIDENCE=<hashes/counts/booleans/safe aggregates only>

NEXT_ACTION=<safe stopping or authority action>
```

See §15-§19 for the canonical environment contract, the required
environment-readiness-before-authorization ordering, environment failure
classification, and the mandatory reviewer question these fields support.

Never include prohibited private values in a report, including private paths,
ticker identities, raw URLs, raw payloads, prices, features, outcomes, or raw
authorization identity.

## 12. Recovery state machine

The generic recovery flow is:

```text
STOP
  -> determine whether private/network/gate boundary was reached
  -> read-only inspect durable state
  -> classify PRE_GATE or POST_GATE
  -> PRE_GATE: propose only non-methodological safe preflight repair
  -> PRE_GATE: re-run preflight from the beginning
  -> POST_GATE: no second execution unless frozen design explicitly authorizes it
  -> return to GPT methodology authority and human authority for next study decision
```

If a state transition is not provable, STOP. A POST_GATE crash, BLOCK, or
partial result never becomes a PRE_GATE failure through cleanup.

## 13. Command quality checklist

Before giving a real-execution PowerShell block, ChatGPT or the execution
agent preparing it must statically check:

- one atomic `& { }` scope or one reviewed `.ps1`;
- `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` inside that scope;
- no automatic-variable name collisions;
- no path continues after a failed preflight;
- no private or network operation before required preflight;
- gate-consumption boundary matches the frozen design;
- no raw secrets are printed;
- `finally` cleanup exists for transient private environment values;
- second-execution behavior is explicit;
- failure output is privacy-safe; and
- no methodology choice is hidden in recovery logic.

## 14. Generic incident rationale

Stale local Git state must be repaired before interpreting a study outcome.
Shell error handling must be atomic because interactive line-by-line
execution can continue after a thrown error. PowerShell's case-insensitive
automatic variables can corrupt ordinary state if reused. One-shot gates
require explicit pre- and post-boundary classification. These are
operational safety rules, not permission to retry a consumed experiment.

This rationale is generic and does not establish any study-specific root
cause or convert a hypothesis into a confirmed fact.

## 15. Canonical Python environment (`.venv-real-execution`)

This repository has two distinct Python environments. Only one is ever
accepted for protected execution:

```text
.venv                 = GENERAL_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT_NOT_AUTHORIZED_FOR_PROTECTED_EXECUTION
.venv-real-execution   = CANONICAL_PROTECTED_REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT
```

The existing `.venv` is a general mixed project/trading-bot environment
(Windows-grounded inspection found it to be Python 3.12.10 with 46
packages, including unrelated dependencies such as `yfinance`, `lightgbm`,
`pytest`, `requests`, `curl_cffi`, `scikit-learn`). It remains available,
untouched, for ordinary project development and is never deleted,
modified, cleaned, or reinterpreted by real-execution tooling -- it is
simply never accepted as the protected interpreter, regardless of its
Python version or which packages happen to be installed in it.

For repository Python protected execution:

- the canonical environment directory is `.venv-real-execution` at the
  repository root; it is never committed to Git;
- all protected execution MUST invoke the interpreter explicitly as
  `.venv-real-execution\Scripts\python.exe` -- never `.venv\Scripts\
  python.exe` (the general environment), `python`, `python3`, `py`, PATH
  activation, or whatever interpreter happens to be currently active;
- system Python and any WindowsApps-alias Python are prohibited for
  protected execution;
- activation (`.venv-real-execution\Scripts\Activate.ps1`) may be
  convenient for a human operator but is never the security/provenance
  mechanism -- an activated shell's `python` can still silently resolve to
  something other than the canonical interpreter, including the general
  `.venv`;
- production code/preflight must verify `sys.executable` resolves to the
  repository's exact `.venv-real-execution\Scripts\python.exe` before any
  gate/network/private boundary. A mismatch is `PRE_GATE_WRONG_PYTHON_
  ENVIRONMENT` (§17) -- including, explicitly, when the resolved
  interpreter is the general `.venv`.

Rationale: the protected environment should minimize dependency drift and
attack surface (every package in it should be traceable to the real
execution import closure, not incidentally present for an unrelated bot
feature), and unrelated development/trading-bot dependency upgrades in
`.venv` must never silently alter the frozen research execution
environment.

Once a reviewed environment lock exists (§19),
`requirements-real-execution.lock.txt` -- not the unpinned
`requirements-real-execution.txt` -- is the protected installation/runtime
package authority: protected packages are resolved and installed
exclusively from that reviewed, exact-pinned lock, with `--no-deps`, so pip
cannot silently add or resolve any package outside the complete reviewed
lock. `requirements-real-execution.txt` remains the direct-dependency
*specification* (§4's traced import closure), not the install source, once
a lock has been captured.

See `REAL_EXECUTION_PYTHON_ENVIRONMENT.md` for the full human-readable
contract (canonical Python version, direct dependency closure, required JPX
Excel engine, bootstrap/readiness procedures, and the environment
lock/fingerprint procedure, including §6a's lock-authority contract),
`requirements-real-execution.txt` for the direct dependency specification,
`requirements-real-execution.lock.txt` for the reviewed exact-pinned
installation authority, `scripts/bootstrap_real_execution_env.ps1` for the
environment-setup-only bootstrap script, and
`scripts/check_real_execution_env.py` for the no-network, no-private-data
readiness checker (including its mechanical environment-lock check).

## 16. Environment readiness BEFORE authorization

The standard order for any protected execution is:

```text
design/freeze PASS
  -> implementation exact-SHA review PASS
  -> repo sync/provenance preflight
  -> canonical .venv-real-execution existence
  -> exact interpreter validation
  -> dependency closure validation
  -> synthetic operational parser probe
  -> filesystem/durable readiness
  -> environment lock/fingerprint verification
  -> ALL PRE_GATE checks PASS
  -> only then request/accept fresh point-of-use human authorization
  -> rerun all non-destructive bindings
  -> consume gate
  -> real execution
```

If authorization was supplied earlier, it still must not be consumed until
every readiness check passes. Environment readiness is part of preflight
(§2), not a substitute for it, and does not relax any other preflight
requirement.

## 17. Environment failure classification

Before the gate's durable receipt is published:

```text
PRE_GATE_ENVIRONMENT_BLOCK
```

Examples: `.venv-real-execution` missing; wrong interpreter
(`PRE_GATE_WRONG_PYTHON_ENVIRONMENT`, including resolving to the general
`.venv`); Python version not exactly `3.12.10`; missing package; wrong
package version; missing Excel engine; parser synthetic-probe failure;
filesystem readiness failure; environment-lock mismatch (reviewed lock
candidate manifest missing/invalid/not matching the reviewed binding, lock
file SHA-256 mismatch, source-requirements canonical Git-bytes provenance
mismatch, or live `pip freeze --all` package set diverging from the
reviewed lock -- extra, missing, or version-drifted). These may be repaired
and the complete preflight rerun from the beginning, but only if no
protected boundary was crossed (§4).

After the gate's durable receipt is published:

```text
POST_GATE_ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE
```

Same underlying causes as above, but discovered only after gate
consumption. No retry authority is created by this classification -- it is
still a `POST_GATE_FAILURE` under §4/§10: no retry, no reset, no receipt
deletion, no reinterpretation of the same human authorization. This is
exactly the failure class this repository's own V8I terminal record
documents (`V8I_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_TERMINAL_ADJUDICATION.json`:
`failure_class=EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE`, a missing `pandas`
dependency discovered only after gate consumption) -- the entire purpose of
§15-§19 is to make that specific class of failure provable-closed-before-
the-gate for future protected execution, not to reopen or excuse that
already-terminal V8I attempt (§20).

## 18. Mandatory reviewer question

For all future protected execution, the reviewer must answer:

```text
CAN_EVERY_REACHABLE_POST_GATE_SOFTWARE_DEPENDENCY_BE_PROVEN_READY_PRE_GATE?
```

Allowed answers: `YES`, `NO`, `UNKNOWN`. `NO` or `UNKNOWN` => STOP; do not
proceed to authorization or gate consumption until the answer is `YES` with
mechanical evidence (§15-§16), including the operational synthetic-parser
probe, not merely `import <package>` succeeding.

## 19. Exact environment lock/fingerprint

An explicitly reviewed command, run on the real target Windows machine
using the canonical interpreter ONLY (never the general `.venv`), generates
the exact environment record:

```powershell
.venv-real-execution\Scripts\python.exe -m pip freeze --all
```

The exact Windows-grounded resolved package set is committed as a dedicated
environment lock/fingerprint artifact (`REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_LOCK_
CANDIDATE.json` and `requirements-real-execution.lock.txt`), subject to its
own GPT exact-SHA independent review, before any future real execution is
authorized. A task that runs only in Claude Code Cloud (or any other
non-Windows environment) must never claim to have produced this
Windows-grounded lock.

A reviewed lock candidate was captured (`artifact_status =
CANDIDATE_NOT_FROZEN`, reviewed at commit
`107430894723c2bdc2f8493cb12c467fccd8665e`). Per
`REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_LOCK_ENFORCEMENT` (§15's `requirements-real-
execution.lock.txt` install-authority rule), that reviewed lock -- not the
unpinned `requirements-real-execution.txt` -- is the protected
installation/runtime package authority, and
`scripts/check_real_execution_env.py`'s `check_environment_lock` mechanical
check (binding to the reviewed manifest/lock/source-provenance/fixture
hashes and the live `pip freeze --all` package set) must `PASS` before
`REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_READY` can be `true`.

**`REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_FREEZE_PROMOTION`: explicit freeze/promotion
completed.** That lock-enforcement implementation was independently GPT
exact-SHA reviewed and Windows-grounded execution tested at implementation
commit `84d4512d800b18b858b6f129be9a4ba0ea73d4ca`; that validation was
itself recorded as a reviewed candidate evidence artifact at commit
`f52f31ab6305e321cd9e8e9855d6efd83238f552`
(`REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_WINDOWS_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE.json`).
`REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_FREEZE_RECORD.json` mechanically binds all
three (the reviewed lock candidate, the tested implementation, and the
reviewed Windows validation evidence) together, and
`scripts/check_real_execution_env.py`'s `check_freeze_record` mechanically
enforces that binding: it requires the live environment-lock check to
itself currently `PASS`, requires the freeze record's complete structural
and semantic content to exactly match the hardcoded reviewed binding,
cross-checks every identity against the same reviewed constants
`check_environment_lock` uses, and independently re-derives the canonical
Git blob SHA-256 of the reviewed Windows validation evidence artifact
(`git cat-file blob <sha>:<path>`, never a checked-out working-tree copy)
rather than trusting any self-reported hash. Only when that check PASSes
together with every existing readiness/lock/probe check does the checker
report:

```text
REAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_FROZEN=true
```

This can only ever happen on a live run inside the exact canonical
`.venv-real-execution`, on the exact reviewed Windows/AMD64/win-amd64
platform, with the exact reviewed package set -- never from Claude Code
Cloud or any other non-Windows run, and never when any existing check is
failing; freezing never weakens, bypasses, or replaces any existing
environment-lock or readiness check.

**Environment freeze is NOT acquisition authorization.** It governs the
Python environment only. `future_protected_execution_authorized` remains
`false` in both the lock candidate and the freeze record. Future protected
execution still requires all study-specific human gates -- a frozen
environment is a necessary precondition for a future gated attempt, never
a substitute for its own separate, study-specific human authorization.

## 20. Prospective-only; V8I permanence

Sections 15-19 are prospective operational/governance hardening only. They
do not, by themselves or in combination:

- reopen V8I;
- authorize a V8I retry or a second JPX request under V8I;
- reset, delete, or reuse the V8I `HUMAN_V8I_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_ACQUISITION_
  GATE` receipt;
- reuse the V8I human authorization;
- reconstruct or preserve the raw source bytes lost in the V8I terminal
  failure; or
- change V8I's `BLOCK_CLOSED` disposition in any way.

V8I remains permanently `BLOCK_CLOSED`, exactly as recorded in
`V8I_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_TERMINAL_ADJUDICATION.json` and
`V8I_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_EXECUTION_INCIDENTS.md`. Any future V8-lineage
source-snapshot attempt is a fresh, independent successor-study identity
with its own fresh gate, receipt key, and authorization grammar; §15-§19
exist only so that a future attempt's own gate cannot be consumed while a
provable, closeable software-environment gap (like V8I's missing `pandas`)
remains undiscovered.
